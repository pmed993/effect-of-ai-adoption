# EDGAR whole-filing keyword extraction

This stage retrieves high-recall AI disclosure candidates from whole SEC annual
filings. It is the project's only EDGAR extraction workflow.

## What it does

1. Reads the project's existing `cik_year.csv` research keys.
2. Uses the SEC `submissions.zip` bulk metadata to identify exact `10-K` and
   `10-K/A` filings. If a referenced historical continuation page is not in the
   bulk file, it is fetched and cached from the official Submissions API.
3. Matches the lookup's `year` to SEC `filingDate` by default. This preserves
   the project's established filing-calendar-year key. `reportDate`, report
   year, and filing year are also retained for audit.
4. Downloads the filing's `primaryDocument`, not every exhibit. If SEC metadata
   lacks a primary document, the complete-submission text is an explicit,
   last-resort fallback; disable it with
   `--no-complete-submission-fallback`.
5. Uses a storage-bounded raw batch (35 GiB by default), extracts each filing,
   checkpoints its result or error, and deletes the batch's primary documents
   before downloading the next batch.
6. Converts the whole primary filing to readable text and applies the existing
   `AI_KEYWORDS` regex dictionary from `ai_adoption_utils.py`.
7. Extracts every hit sentence with a configurable number of surrounding
   sentences, defaulting to `±1`.
8. Merges overlapping or immediately adjacent windows and removes only exact
   whitespace-normalized duplicate chunks.
9. Writes long-format RDS chunks that the existing AI-adoption pipeline can
   read. Filings without a dictionary hit receive a metadata-only, empty-text
   sentinel row so the scorer still emits its normal hard-zero observation and
   the research-sample denominator is not lost.

This stage does not rank evidence, impose a character budget, pick a best
window, or decide whether a mention proves adoption. Ambiguous dictionary terms
are deliberately retained here; disambiguation and adoption scoring remain in
`get_ai_adoption`.

## One-command run

Create an environment once:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv-edgar
source .venv-edgar/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -r "code/main/1. get_edgar_extract/requirements.txt"
```

Then run from the repository root using a truthful SEC contact identity:

```bash
python3 "code/main/1. get_edgar_extract/edgar_keyword_extract.py" run \
  --company "King's College London" \
  --email "pio.medolla@kcl.ac.uk" \
  --raw-batch-gib 35 \
  --context-sentences 1 \
  --extract-workers 2
```

`--raw-batch-gib 35` is a temporary **disk-space** target, not a request to
hold 35 GiB in RAM. Downloads can exceed the target by at most the few filings
already in flight. Keep at least 10–15 GiB additional free for the SEC metadata
archive, unusually large filings, manifests, window JSON and assembled output.
Use a smaller value if the volume has less than roughly 50 GiB free.

Defaults:

- lookup: `code/main/2. get_ai_adoption/lookup/cik_year.csv`
- work directory: `cache/edgar_keyword_windows`
- year rule: SEC filing year
- forms: both `10-K` and `10-K/A`
- SEC request rate: 8 requests/second, capped at 10
- extraction workers: 2 by default and recommended on this 8 GiB machine
- temporary raw batch: approximately 35 GiB
- temporary primary documents: deleted after every raw batch
- manifest checkpoint interval: 250 completed filings
- storage grouping: 1,000 whole filings per output file

The bulk metadata, manifest, and per-filing results are resumable. A second run
reuses valid extraction results without re-downloading deleted primary
documents. Failed extraction inputs are also deleted after their error is
checkpointed, preventing failures from accumulating outside the storage
budget; a rerun downloads those filings again. A full `run` refuses to assemble
outputs while any filing remains incomplete. Output chunks are protected from
accidental overwrite; pass `--overwrite-chunks` when intentionally rebuilding
them.

Changing `--context-sentences` invalidates old per-filing windows and causes the
affected primary documents to be downloaded again. Pass `--refresh-metadata`
when a later run should replace the cached nightly SEC bulk archive.

Use `--keep-raw` only when intentionally retaining the complete raw corpus; in
that mode the 35 GiB batch boundary still controls processing, but disk usage
accumulates across batches.

Every full `run` writes `qa_summary.json` automatically. QA reopens every saved
filing result and checks its source hash, extraction version, accession, window
count, source-order IDs, text hashes, duplicate hashes, and that every recorded
matched term occurs in its window. Assembly is refused when status or result
validation is incomplete. It also reopens every RDS chunk, compares its row
count with the compressed CSV mirror, and verifies that assembled accessions
exactly match the filing manifest.

## Deterministic live samples

Use `--sample-filings` to exercise the complete workflow without processing the
entire research sample:

```bash
python3 "code/main/1. get_edgar_extract/edgar_keyword_extract.py" run \
  --company "King's College London" \
  --email "pio.medolla@kcl.ac.uk" \
  --sample-filings 1100 \
  --raw-batch-gib 35 \
  --extract-workers 2
```

Sampling is deterministic and proportional across form type and filing year.
It prefers distinct CIKs within each stratum, then fills any remaining quota.
Change the stable selection with `--sample-seed`. Selected accessions and
stratum counts are saved in `sample_selection.json`; sample CIK-year keys are
saved in `sample_lookup.csv`, and the complete unsampled manifest is retained
as `sec/full_filing_manifest.csv.gz` for audit.

Pass an existing archive with `--submissions-zip /path/to/submissions.zip` to
reuse SEC bulk metadata instead of downloading another approximately 1.5 GiB
copy.

For a nonstandard research definition, `--year-match report-date` is available,
but it should not be used for the current project lookup.

## Capacity and runtime estimate

The project lookup contains 49,533 requested CIK-year keys across 5,479 CIKs
and filing years 2015–2026. The official bulk metadata used for the 1,100-file
QA run produced 43,409 matching filings: 38,721 `10-K` and 4,688 `10-K/A`.
A later refreshed archive may differ slightly.

A stratified sample of 1,100 actual SEC primary documents across years and
forms transferred 3.30 GiB and had these transfer sizes:

- overall median: 2.39 MiB
- overall mean: 3.07 MiB
- largest sampled primary document: 67.8 MiB
- weighted projection: about 130 GiB of primary documents
- official submissions metadata ZIP: about 1.45 GiB at the time tested

With the default 35 GiB temporary raw budget, the projected 130 GiB transfer is
processed in approximately four raw batches instead of being retained at
once. Plan for roughly 45–50 GiB free at startup. Final requirements depend on
the number and length of keyword windows, but they should be far below the full
raw corpus. If space becomes constrained, lower `--raw-batch-gib`; this changes
only the number of processing batches, not the extracted content.

At the default 8 SEC requests/second, 43,409 filing requests have an absolute
request-start floor of about 1.5 hours. Approximate raw-transfer floors for
130 GiB are:

| Sustained download speed | Transfer floor |
|---:|---:|
| 20 Mbit/s | 14.5 hours |
| 50 Mbit/s | 5.8 hours |
| 100 Mbit/s | 2.9 hours |
| 200 Mbit/s | 1.5 hours, where the SEC request rate also becomes limiting |

Local sparse-hit benchmarks after the parser and matcher optimizations achieved
about 5.6 MiB/s with one extraction process and 20 MiB/s with four processes on
2 MiB documents. That implies roughly 1.3 hours of pure extraction at four
workers; real inline-XBRL complexity and disk I/O can increase this.

A practical end-to-end expectation, including metadata, HTTP overhead, retries,
local extraction, and assembly, is:

- fast stable 100+ Mbit/s connection: approximately 5–9 hours
- typical 50 Mbit/s connection: approximately 8–13 hours
- 20 Mbit/s connection: approximately 17–24 hours

For planning, run it overnight and allow up to 24 hours. The pipeline checkpoints
downloads and per-filing extraction, so an interrupted run can be restarted with
the same command.

## Run individual stages

The `run` command is the recommended storage-bounded workflow. The individual
commands remain available for debugging and controlled reruns:

```bash
python3 "code/main/1. get_edgar_extract/edgar_keyword_extract.py" manifest \
  --company "King's College London" --email "pio.medolla@kcl.ac.uk"

python3 "code/main/1. get_edgar_extract/edgar_keyword_extract.py" download \
  --company "King's College London" --email "pio.medolla@kcl.ac.uk"

python3 "code/main/1. get_edgar_extract/edgar_keyword_extract.py" extract \
  --context-sentences 1

python3 "code/main/1. get_edgar_extract/edgar_keyword_extract.py" assemble

python3 "code/main/1. get_edgar_extract/edgar_keyword_extract.py" qa
```

The standalone `download` command intentionally downloads and retains every
primary filing; it does **not** apply the 35 GiB purge cycle. Do not use it for
the full sample unless the destination has space for the entire raw corpus.

## Outputs and handoff

Important outputs under `cache/edgar_keyword_windows` are:

```text
filing_manifest.csv
sample_lookup.csv                       sample-only CIK-year keys
sample_selection.json                  deterministic sample audit
sec/metadata_coverage.csv             every requested CIK-year, including misses
sec/full_filing_manifest.csv.gz       unsampled manifest for sample runs
raw/10-K/...                          temporary primary documents
raw/10-K-A/...                        temporary amendments
windows/10-K/...                      auditable per-filing JSON results
windows/10-K-A/...
assembled/extract_df_chunk_*.rds      scorer-compatible inputs
assembled/extract_df_chunk_*.csv.gz
assembled/extraction_summary.json
data_workspace_rds/extract_df_chunk_*.rds  upload-ready RDS-only folder
data_workspace_rds.zip                    OneDrive transfer bundle
qa_summary.json
```

After a successful full run, `raw/` should contain no successfully extracted
filings. The manifest retains their source URLs, byte counts, SHA-256 hashes,
processing-batch identifiers and deletion timestamps for audit and resume.

Every RDS window row contains the existing required fields:

```text
item = keyword_window
year
accession_number
cik
form_type
text
```

It also contains window offsets, keyword names, source URL, filing/report
dates, primary-document name, hashes, and extraction version. All windows for
one accession stay in one RDS file, so a filing cannot be split across storage
chunks. A no-hit sentinel is marked with `window_id = 0` and
`is_no_keyword_sentinel = TRUE`; it contains no filing text and is not counted
as a keyword window in the extraction summary.

After successful assembly validation, the pipeline automatically copies the
exact final RDS set into `data_workspace_rds/` and creates
`data_workspace_rds.zip`. The folder contains no CSV mirrors or temporary
filings. Move the ZIP through OneDrive, extract it in Data Workspace, and upload
the extracted RDS files to a clean team prefix used by
`get_ai_score_bulk.py`.

To recreate the folder and ZIP later without rerunning SEC downloads or text
extraction:

```bash
python3 "code/main/1. get_edgar_extract/edgar_keyword_extract.py" package \
  --data-dir cache/edgar_keyword_windows
```

The package command revalidates the assembled chunks against the filing
manifest before copying anything. The ZIP uses the RDS filenames at its root,
so extraction produces the upload-ready files directly. The scorer joins all
`keyword_window` rows for a filing in source order and keeps both `10-K` and
`10-K/A`.

## Dependencies

Python dependencies are listed in this folder's `requirements.txt`. Assembly
also requires `Rscript` and the R package `data.table`, matching the existing
RDS workflow.
